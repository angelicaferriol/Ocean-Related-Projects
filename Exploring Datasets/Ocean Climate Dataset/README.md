## 1. Data Visualization Dashboard 

### Description
This project visualizes key oceanic data trends, providing a clear understanding of the state of coral reefs and their surrounding environments. The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
- **SST Trends Over Time**: Graphs showing how Sea Surface Temperature (SST) has changed over time.
- **Locations with the Most Bleaching**: Heatmaps or bar charts highlighting regions with significant coral bleaching.
- **Correlation between SST, pH, Bleaching, and Marine Heatwaves**: Scatter plots or other charts exploring the relationships between these variables.

### Technologies Used
-  Jupyter Notebook / Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 2. Marine Heatwave Predictor

### Description
This machine learning model predicts the likelihood of a marine heatwave event based on variables like Sea Surface Temperature (SST), pH, location, and date. The model will help predict future events and assist in making proactive conservation decisions.

### Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
- Random Forest / Neural Networks

### Features
- Predicts the occurrence of marine heatwaves
- Utilizes historical data to train the model
- Evaluation with precision, recall, and accuracy metrics

## 3. Coral Bleaching Severity Classifier

### Description
This classification model predicts the severity of coral bleaching using features such as SST, pH, and observed species. The goal is to classify bleaching events as mild, moderate, or severe to prioritize conservation efforts.

### Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

### Features
- Categorizes coral bleaching severity
- Uses environmental data (SST, pH) and species presence data for training

## 4. Species Diversity Analyzer 

### Description
Analyzes the impact of environmental changes (e.g., marine heatwaves and coral bleaching) on species diversity. The tool explores:
- Changes in species count over time
- Biodiversity hotspots
- The effect of marine heatwaves and bleaching on species numbers

### Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Time series analysis

### Features
- Calculates biodiversity indices
- Compares regions for diversity
- Identifies regions most affected by environmental changes

---

## 5. Climate Change Storytelling Report 

### Description
This project combines data analysis with narrative storytelling. The goal is to communicate how climate change and ocean conditions have worsened, using simple data analysis and visualizations.

### Technologies Used
- Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook or Sphinx for documentation

### Features
- Narrative-driven report
- Visualizations showing the deterioration of ocean conditions
- Simple data analysis for illustrating climate change impacts

---

## 6. Interactive Map 

### Description
This project uses interactive maps to display ocean data visually, such as SST or coral bleaching severity across different locations. Using libraries like Folium or Plotly, the map updates dynamically as users interact with it.

### Technologies Used
- Python (Folium, Plotly)
- Geospatial data analysis

### Features
- Interactive mapping of ocean data
- Allows users to explore different regions and their environmental conditions

---

## 7. Anomaly Detection 

### Description
Identifies anomalies in ocean data, such as sudden temperature spikes or unexpected bleaching events, using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. This project helps detect unusual events that could indicate a major environmental change.

### Technologies Used
- Python (scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- Isolation Forest, Z-Score Method, or Autoencoders

### Features
- Detects outliers in ocean data
- Flags unusual marine events (temperature spikes, bleaching incidents)
