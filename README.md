# Ocean Projects Playground

Welcome to my **Ocean Projects Playground** — a personal repository where I combine my passion for the ocean with my journey of learning different programming tools, data analysis methods, and creative technologies.

This space serves as a sandbox for experimenting, building, and exploring how technology can interact with and help understand marine environments.

---

## Purpose

- **Learn**: Practice and apply new programming tools, libraries, and techniques.
- **Experiment**: Build small, varied projects around ocean-related data, science, and storytelling.
- **Explore**: Discover intersections between technology, environmental science, and creative expression.

---

## Technologies I'm Exploring

- **Programming Languages**: Python, (future expansion into R, Julia, etc.)
- **Data Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Storytelling and Visualization**: Jupyter Notebook, Sphinx, Plotly
- **Other**: Version control with Git/GitHub, documentation best practices

## Future Ideas

- Predictive models for ocean conditions
- Interactive dashboards for marine data
- Biodiversity simulations
- AI-assisted monitoring tools
